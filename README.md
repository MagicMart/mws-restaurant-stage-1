# Restaurant Reviews App - stage 1
---
#### Project 6 of Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship!

## Description

I forked and cloned the starter code for the project from [here.](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1)
I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted it to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for **screen reader** use. I also added a **service worker** to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience.

### Google Maps

This project uses google maps. I had to obtain an API key from [here.](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
